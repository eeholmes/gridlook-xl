## Try It Live

Try out the example dataset:

https://gridlook.pages.dev

You can view any CORS-enabled, public Zarr dataset with GridLook:

```
https://gridlook.pages.dev/#<ZARR_URI>
```

Gridlook can also load catalog JSON files that list multiple datasets. The catalog format and deployment options are documented in [docs/catalogs.md](docs/catalogs.md).

A guide to the viewer keyboard, mouse, and touch interaction is available in [docs/Controls.md](docs/Controls.md).

## Project Setup

```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

## Usage

The project is served at http://localhost:3000/ when you run `npm run dev`.

## CORS & Hosting Notes

To load datasets from services like DKRZ Swift, ensure [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) is enabled on the server.

Example for the nextGEMS container on Swift:

```
swift post nextGEMS -m "X-Container-Meta-Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*"
```

This allows GridLook to fetch data directly from the container in your browser.
